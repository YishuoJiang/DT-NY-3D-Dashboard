# Geopipe Unity Asset Pack 4


## Render Pipelines

The materials provided in this asset are setup for the `Standard Render Pipeline`.
We have tested using the built in convertors for each URP and HDRP and they work with out issue.

## Prefab

The asset is imported as single preset: `NYBlock04`. You can simply unpack the prefab if you want to have each model seperated to support various workflows.

Within the prefab are different Building, Objects, and Terrain categories. Objects and Terrain are further subdivided into the different types of meshes contained within the model.
